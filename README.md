# PromiseProject1

Simple project that uses Promises instead of callbacks to fetch some local posts to the browser screen.<br />
Shows Promise declaration and how we handle the errors properly.<br />

npm install -> installs all the libraries<br />
npm run dev -> creates the webpack bundle and watches for changed files<br />

You can use live server to open the html file.
